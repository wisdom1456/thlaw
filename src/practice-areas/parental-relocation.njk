                    <p> A parent may be prohibited from relocating a childâ€™s residence more than 50 miles from their current residence if certain conditions apply. Parents who wish to relocate outside of the permissible radius (50 miles) and who do not have the written consent of the other parent, must file a petition for relocation and comply with the statutory requirements prior to obtaining a court order allowing said relocation. </p>
